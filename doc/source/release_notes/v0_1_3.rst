Version 0.1.3
=============

Bugfixes
--------
- Some missing attributes were added to Gloria's serialization module that caused :meth:`Gloria.to_dict`, :meth:`Gloria.from_dict`, :meth:`Gloria.to_json`, and :meth:`Gloria.from_json` to fail (`#88 <https://github.com/e-dyn/gloria/issues/88>`_).

Stan Backend
------------
A number of changes to all models have been implemented to all Stan models to enhance robustness and maintainability of the Stan backend. All changes are related to issue `#84 <https://github.com/e-dyn/gloria/issues/84>`_

- All functions defined in the ``functions`` block were moved to ``utilities.stan`` and imported back to the model files using the ``#include`` directive (`#99 <https://github.com/e-dyn/gloria/issues/99>`_)
